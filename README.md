# Atlas Framework Snippets

## Introduction

All official snippets related to Atlas Framework. This includes the core and all other Atlas resources. This extension will be constantly updated by adding new core functions, events, and more. Don't forget that you can give us a hand in the official [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AtlasFw/vsc-atl) or by writing a [review](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtlasFramework.atlas-framework-snippets&ssr=false#review-details).

## Installation
This [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension adds snippets from atl-core and other resources which have usable functions. You can easily download it by searching "Atlas Framework" on the [extensions tab](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_search-for-an-extension) or by installing it from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtlasFramework.atlas-framework-snippets&ssr=false#review-details).

## Documentation
If you need further help, you can take a look at our awesome [documentation](https://atlasfw.live/documentation) made with docsify.

## How to Use
Currently, we only have Lua support which includes both client and server functions with an additional support for importing from your fxmanifest. To start, just type `ATL` or even the name of the function such as `RemoveAccountMoney`. Once you are hovering over your desired function, you can press `Tab` to autocomplete the function. You will see that your caret is now on one of the parameters, you can press `Tab` again to move to the next one. This can be done with all the parameters and will only be canceled if you select something else with your mouse cursor.

## Issues
